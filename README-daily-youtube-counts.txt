Daily YouTube subscriber count updater

This site does not need a YouTube API key.

Run this command once per day from the studiomotion-backup folder:

node tools/update-youtube-counts.mjs

The script pulls the visible subscriber text from each YouTube channel page and writes it to:

data/channel-counts.json

The website reads that JSON file when the Ventura coach page loads.

To force a refresh more than once in the same day:

node tools/update-youtube-counts.mjs --force
